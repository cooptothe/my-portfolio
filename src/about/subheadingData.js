            Hey there! I'm Edward Cooper, a versatile Software Engineer with a
            knack for diving into tasks headfirst. My journey kickstarted in the
            realm of education and customer service, where adaptability and
            precision were my strong suits. Now, transitioning into tech, I'm on
            fire with a newfound passion for crafting innovative solutions to
            real-world challenges through code. My mission? To blend my existing
            strengths with tech prowess, making a positive impact through
            seamless, user-focused software. I've got the skills—JavaScript,
            TypeScript, React, Node.js, Express, MySQL—and the drive to thrive
            in this fast-paced realm. Let's code a brighter tomorrow together!
